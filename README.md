# SOEN 331

This Repository contains the programming assignments from Concordia's SOEN 331 class named `Introduction to Formal Methods`.

## Setup

To setup LaTeX for VsCode, I personally followed the linux install described in [this guide](https://mathjiajia.github.io/vscode-and-latex/).

### Useful VsCode Extension

- LaTeX Workshop
- VSC-Prolog

## Contributing

When working on the assignments, please work under the `assignment{x}` branch (where `{x}` is the assignment number) and not `main`.

## Submissions

Your main submission consists of a `.tex` file and its corresponding `.pdf` compilation. All code should:

1.  Be embedded in your main submission file and
2.  Be included as supporting documentation in separate files, and placed in a folder called `/code`.

All demonstrations of interactions with a language
environment should be embedded in your main submission file.

Place all the above files (`.tex`, `.pdf`, and the `/code` folder) into a folder that is named after
you and your partner, where the name of the person to submit goes first.

> **Example:** If Lisa Gerrard
> and Nick Cave were partners and Lisa were the one to submit, then the folder is called
> `/gerrard-cave.zip`, and submit it at the Electronic Assignment Submission portal at (https://fis.encs.concordia.ca/eas) under Assignment X.
